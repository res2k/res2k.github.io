        <h1>Current-ish stuff</h1>
        <a href="HDRTray">HDRTray</a> - Windows Notification Area icon to show and change HDR status.<br>
        Useful if you you quickly want to check the current setting, maybe because it might been changed automatically by some applications, or maybe just because you're forgetful.<br>
        Also allows quick toggling.
        <h1>Old Stuff</h1>
        <a href="SteamLibrarian">SteamLibrarian</a> - A tool to manage a Steam library distributed over folders on multiple drives, see how much space a game takes up, and move it between folders.<br/>
        Mostly superseded by Steam providing "move" functionality itself.
